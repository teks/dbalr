Iteration 1
[ ] 

Backlog
[ ] I can't make `cargo test` execute floor.rs tests unless lib.rs or main.rs
is importing this file.  Something I haven't tried yet is making floor.rs, its
own 'target' in Cargo.toml, because cargo seems to consider only target files
and things linked from them (main & lib are automatically targets evidently).
