Iteration 1
[v] how do I de-randomize for testing purposes? dependency injection?
[v] 0 to 3 cells, chosen randomly, have no rooms ("ISGONE"; also empty cells may have passages?)
[v] room generation
    [v] set room type: small, medium, large, maze
    [v] set room lighting: light, dark (mazes are always dark)
[ ] passage generation

Iteration 2
[ ] room filling: gold & monster generation in do_rooms() and maybe put_things()
[ ] where is the stairwell put?

Backlog
[ ] I can't make `cargo test` execute floor.rs tests unless lib.rs or main.rs
is importing this file.  Something I haven't tried yet is making floor.rs, its
own 'target' in Cargo.toml, because cargo seems to consider only target files
and things linked from them (main & lib are automatically targets evidently).
